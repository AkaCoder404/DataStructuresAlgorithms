# Data Structures and Algorithms
A repository containing my journey with data structures and algorithms.

## Implementations
Implementing different data structures and their basic functionality by hand (mostly in python). For example, the linked list data structure is implemented in `Implementation\List.py` and can be declared as such

```python
myList = List[int]() # declare and be able to handle generics/typing
for i in range(0, 20): # generate random numbers
  n = random.randint(1,100)
  myList.insertAasLast(e)

test.traverse() # print out unsorted
test._radixSort() # use radix sort
test.traverse() # print out sorted
```

More specific details can be found in code

Data structures implemented so far
1. List
2. Vector
3. Stack (using List and Vector)
4. Queue (using List)
3. Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree

Data structures to be implemented
4. BST - AVL, Red Black, BT, Splay
5. Graphs

### Things Learned
1. TypeVar, Genrics, and typing in Python 
2. Python Classes and Inheritance

## Visualizations
Visualizing data structures and algorithms. For example, visualizing linked list sorting algorithms is implemented in `Visualization\ListSorting.py` and is implemented using Pygame, it is a very basic implementation
